|The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one else would have done
|seems to me to show that they have some sense of shame left.
|They have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.
|
|They don't seem to notice us at all. Couldn't you cough?
|But I haven't got a cough.
|They're looking at us. What effrontery!
|They're approaching. That's very forward of them.
|Let us preserve a dignified silence.
|Certainly. It's the only thing to do now.
|
|This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.
|A most distasteful one.
|But we will not be the first to speak.
|Certainly not.
|
|Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you.
|Much depends on your reply.
|Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable.
|Mr. Moncrieff, kindly answer me the following question.
|Why did you pretend to be my guardian's brother?
|In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.
|That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?
|Yes, dear, if you can believe him.
|I don't.
|But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.
|True. In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.
| Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for pretending to have a brother?
|Was it in order that you might have an opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?
|Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?
|I have the gravest doubts upon the subject. But I intend to crush them.
|This is not the moment for German scepticism.
|Their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially Mr. Worthing's.
|That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.
|I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said. His voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity.
|Then you think we should forgive them?
|Yes.
|I mean no.
|True! I had forgotten.
|There are principles at stake that one cannot surrender.
|Which of us should tell them? The task is not a pleasant one.
|Could we not both speak at the same time?
|An excellent idea! I nearly always speak at the same time as other people.
|Will you take the time from me?
|Certainly.
| Your Christian names are still an insuperable barrier. That is all!
|Our Christian names! Is that all? But we are going to be christened this afternoon.
|For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible thing?
|I am.
|To please me you are ready to face this fearful ordeal?
|I am!
|How absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes!
|Where questions of self-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.
|We are.
|They have moments of physical courage of which we women know absolutely nothing.
|Darling!
|Darling!
|
|Ahem! Ahem! Lady Bracknell!
|Good heavens!
|Gwendolen! What does this mean?
|Merely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing, mamma.
|Come here. Sit down.
|Sit down immediately.
|Hesitation of any kind is a sign of mental decay in the young,
|of physical weakness in the old.
|Apprised, sir, of my daughter's sudden flight by her trusty maid
|whose confidence I purchased by means of a small coin
|I followed her at once by a luggage train.
|Her unhappy father is, I am glad to say, under the impression
|that she is attending a more than usually lengthy lecture
|by the University Extension Scheme on the Influence of a permanent income on Thought.
|I do not propose to undeceive him. Indeed I have never undeceived him on any question.
|I would consider it wrong.
|But of course, you will clearly understand that all communication
|between yourself and my daughter must cease immediately from this moment.
|On this point, as indeed on all points, I am firm.
|I am engaged to be married to Gwendolen Lady Bracknell!
|You are nothing of the kind, sir. And now, as regards Algernon!
|
|Algernon!
|Yes, Aunt Augusta.
|May I ask if it is in this house that your invalid friend Mr. Bunbury resides?
|Oh! No! Bunbury doesn't live here. Bunbury is somewhere else at present.
|In fact,
|Bunbury is dead.
|Dead! When did Mr. Bunbury die? His death must have been extremely sudden.
|Oh! I killed Bunbury this afternoon..
|I mean... poor Bunbury died this afternoon.
|What did he die of?
|Bunbury? Oh, he was quite...
|exploded.
|Exploded! Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage?
|I was not aware that Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation.
|If so, he is well punished for his morbidity.
|My dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out!
|The doctors found out that Bunbury could not live, that is what I mean
|so Bunbury died.
|He seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of his physicians.
|I am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some definite course of action,
|and acted under proper medical advice.
|And now that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury, may I ask, Mr. Worthing,
|who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is now holding
|in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?
|That lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward.
|I am engaged to be married to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.
|I beg your pardon?
|Mr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.
|I do not know whether there is anything peculiarly exciting
|in the air of this particular part of Hertfordshire,
|but the number of engagements that go on seems to me considerably
|above the proper average that statistics have laid down for our guidance.
|I think some preliminary inquiry on my part would not be out of place.
|Mr. Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all connected
|with any of the larger railway stations in London?
|I merely desire information.
|Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any families or persons
|whose origin was a Terminus.
|Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter of the late Mr. Thomas Cardew of
|149 Belgrave Square, S.W.;
|Gervase Park, Dorking, Surrey;
|and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.
|That sounds not unsatisfactory. Three addresses always inspire confidence, even in tradesmen.
|But what proof have I of their authenticity?
|I have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period. They are open to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.
|I have known strange errors in that publication.
|Miss Cardew's family solicitors are Messrs. Markby, Markby, and Markby.
|Markby, Markby, and Markby?
|A firm of the very highest position in their profession.
|Indeed I am told that one of the Mr. Markby's is occasionally to be seen at dinner parties.
|So far I am satisfied.
|How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell!
|I have also in my possession, you will be pleased to hear,
|certificates of Miss Cardew's birth, baptism, whooping cough,
|registration, vaccination, confirmation, and the measles;
|both the German and the English variety.
|Ah! A life crowded with incident, I see;
|though perhaps somewhat too exciting for a young girl.
|I am not myself in favour of premature experiences.
|Gwendolen! the time approaches for our departure. We have not a moment to lose.
|As a matter of form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any little fortune?
|Oh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds. That is all. Goodbye,
|So pleased to have seen you.
|A moment, Mr. Worthing. A hundred and thirty thousand pounds! And in the Funds!
|Miss Cardew seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her.
|Few girls of the present day have any really solid qualities,
|any of the qualities that last, and improve with time.
|We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces.
|Come over here, dear.
|
|Pretty child! your dress is sadly simple,
|and your hair seems almost as Nature might have left it.
|But we can soon alter all that.
|A thoroughly experienced French maid produces a really marvellous result
|in a very brief space of time.
|I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing,
|and after three months her own husband did not know her.
|And after six months nobody knew her.
|Kindly turn round, sweet child.
|
|No, the side view is what I want.
|Yes, quite as I expected.
|There are distinct social possibilities in your profile.
|The two weak points in our age are its want of principle and its want of profile.
|The chin a little higher, dear.
|Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn.
|They are worn very high, just at present.
|Algernon!
|Yes, Aunt Augusta!
|There are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew's profile.
|Cecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the whole world.
|And I don't care twopence about social possibilities.
|Never speak disrespectfully of Society,
|Only people who can't get into it do that.
|Dear child, of course you know that Algernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon.
|But I do not approve of mercenary marriages.
|When I married Lord Bracknell I had no fortune of any kind.
|But I never dreamed for a moment of allowing that to stand in my way.
|Well, I suppose I must give my consent.
|Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
|Cecily, you may kiss me!
|Thank you, Lady Bracknell.
|You may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future.
|Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
|The marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.
|Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
|Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
|To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements.
|They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage,
|which I think is never advisable.
|I beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell,
|but this engagement is quite out of the question.
|I am Miss Cardew's guardian,
|and she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age.
|That consent I absolutely decline to give.
|Upon what grounds may I ask?
|Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man.
|He has nothing, but he looks everything. What more can one desire?
|It pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady Bracknell, about your nephew,
|but the fact is that I do not approve at all of his moral character.
|I suspect him of being untruthful.
|Untruthful! My nephew Algernon? Impossible! He is an Oxonian.
|I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter.
|This afternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important question of romance,
|he obtained admission to my house by means of the false pretence of being my brother.
|Under an assumed name he drank, I've just been informed by my butler,
|an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet, Brut, '89; wine I was specially reserving for myself.
|Continuing his disgraceful deception,
|he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienating the affections of my only ward.
|He subsequently stayed to tea, and devoured every single muffin.
|And what makes his conduct all the more heartless is,
|that he was perfectly well aware from the first that I have no brother,
|that I never had a brother, and that I don't intend to have a brother,
|not even of any kind. I distinctly told him so myself yesterday afternoon.
|Ahem! Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration
|I have decided entirely to overlook my nephew's conduct to you.
|That is very generous of you,
|My own decision, however, is unalterable. I decline to give my consent.
|Come here, sweet child.
|How old are you, dear?
|Well, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty when I go to evening parties.
|You are perfectly right in making some slight alteration.
|Indeed, no woman should ever be quite accurate about her age. It looks so calculating...
|Eighteen, but admitting to twenty at evening parties.
|Well, it will not be very long before you are of age and free from the restraints of tutelage.
|So I don't think your guardian's consent is, after all, a matter of any importance.
|Pray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting you again,
|but it is only fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather's will
|Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.
|That does not seem to me to be a grave objection. Thirty-five is a very attractive age.
|London society is full of women of the very highest birth who have, of their own free choice,
|remained thirty-five for years. Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point.
|To my own knowledge she has been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of forty,
|which was many years ago now.
|I see no reason why our dear Cecily should not be even still more attractive
|at the age you mention than she is at present. There will be a large accumulation of property.
|Algy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?
|Of course I could,
|You know I could.
|Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn't wait all that time.
|I hate waiting even five minutes for anybody. It always makes me rather cross.
|I am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in others,
|and waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.
|Then what is to be done, Cecily?
|I don't know, Mr. Moncrieff.
|My dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positively
|that she cannot wait till she is thirty-five,
|a remark which I am bound to say seems to me to show a somewhat impatient nature,
|I would beg of you to reconsider your decision.
|But my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own hands.
|The moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen,
|I will most gladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.
|You must be quite aware that what you propose is out of the question.
|Then a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward to.
|That is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen.
|Algernon, of course, can choose for himself.
|Come, dear, we have already missed five, if not six, trains.
|To miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform.
|Everything is quite ready for the christenings.
|The christenings, sir!  Is not that somewhat premature?
|Both these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.
|At their age?  The idea is grotesque and irreligious!
|Algernon, I forbid you to be baptized.  I will not hear of such excesses.
|Lord Bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned
|that that was the way in which you wasted your time and money.
|Am I to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all this afternoon?
|I don't think that, as things are now,
|it would be of much practical value to either of us, Dr. Chasuble.
|I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing.
|They savour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists,
|views that I have completely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons.
|However, as your present mood seems to be one peculiarly secular,
|I will return to the church at once.
|Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener that for the last hour and a half
|Miss Prism has been waiting for me in the vestry.
|Miss Prism!  Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism?
|Yes, I am on my way to join her.
|Pray allow me to detain you for a moment.
|This matter may prove to be one of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself.
|Is this Miss Prism a female of repellent aspect,
|remotely connected with education?
|She is the most cultivated of ladies, and the very picture of respectability.
|It is obviously the same person.
|May I ask what position she holds in your household?
|I am a celibate, madam.
|Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last three years
|Miss Cardew's esteemed governess and valued companion.
|In spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once.
|Let her be sent for.
|She approaches; she is nigh.
|I was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon.
|I have been waiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters.
|Prism! Come here, Prism!
|Prism!  Where is that baby?
|Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell's house,
|Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street,
|in charge of a perambulator that contained a baby of the male sex.
|You never returned.
|A few weeks later, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police,
|the perambulator was discovered at midnight,
|standing by itself in a remote corner of Bayswater.
|It contained the manuscript of a three-volume novel
|of more than usually revolting sentimentality.
|But the baby was not there!
|Prism!  Where is that baby?
|Lady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know.
|I only wish I did.
|The plain facts of the case are these.
|On the morning of the day you mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory,
|I prepared as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator.
|I had also with me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag
|in which I had intended to place the manuscript of a work of fiction
|that I had written during my few unoccupied hours.
|In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I never can forgive myself,
|I deposited the manuscript in the basinette, and placed the baby in the hand-bag.
|But where did you deposit the hand-bag?
|Do not ask me, Mr. Worthing.
|Miss Prism, this is a matter of no small importance to me.
|I insist on knowing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained that infant.
|I left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway stations in London.
|What railway station?
|Victoria.  The Brighton line.
|I must retire to my room for a moment.
|Gwendolen, wait here for me.
|If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life.
|What do you think this means, Lady Bracknell?
|I dare not even suspect, Dr.
|I need hardly tell you that in families of high position
|strange coincidences are not supposed to occur.
|They are hardly considered the thing.
|Uncle Jack seems strangely agitated.
|Your guardian has a very emotional nature.
|This noise is extremely unpleasant.
|It sounds as if he was having an argument.
|I dislike arguments of any kind.
|They are always vulgar, and often convincing.
|It has stopped now.
|I wish he would arrive at some conclusion.
|This suspense is terrible.  I hope it will last.
|Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism?
|Examine it carefully before you speak.
|The happiness of more than one life depends on your answer.
|It seems to be mine.
|Yes, here is the injury it received
|through the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and happier days.
|Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a temperance beverage,
|an incident that occurred at Leamington.
| And here, on the lock, are my initials.
| I had forgotten that in an extravagant mood I had had them placed there.
|The bag is undoubtedly mine.
|I am delighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me.
|It has been a great inconvenience being without it all these years.
|Miss Prism, more is restored to you than this hand-bag.
|I was the baby you placed in it.
|You?
|Yes... mother!
|Mr. Worthing!  I am unmarried!
|Unmarried!  I do not deny that is a serious blow.
|But after all, who has the right to cast a stone against one who has suffered?
|Cannot repentance wipe out an act of folly?
|Why should there be one law for men, and another for women?
|Mother, I forgive you.
|Mr. Worthing, there is some error.
|There is the lady who can tell you who you really are.
|Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, but would you kindly inform me who I am?
|I am afraid that the news I have to give you will not altogether please you.
|You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs. Moncrieff,
|and consequently Algernon's elder brother.
|Algy's elder brother!
|Then I have a brother after all.
|I knew I had a brother!  I always said I had a brother!
|Cecily, how could you have ever doubted that I had a brother?
|Dr. Chasuble, my unfortunate brother.
|Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother.
|Gwendolen, my unfortunate brother.
|Algy, you young scoundrel, you will have to treat me with more respect in the future.
|You have never behaved to me like a brother in all your life.
|Well, not till to-day, old boy, I admit.
|I did my best, however, though I was out of practice.
|My own!  But what own are you?
|What is your Christian name, now that you have become some one else?
|Good heavens! I had quite forgotten that point.
|Your decision on the subject of my name is irrevocable, I suppose?
|I never change, except in my affections.
|What a noble nature you have, Gwendolen!
|Then the question had better be cleared up at once.
|Aunt Augusta, a moment.
|At the time when Miss Prism left me in the hand-bag, had I been christened already?
|Every luxury that money could buy, including christening,
|had been lavished on you by your fond and doting parents.
|Then I was christened!  That is settled.
|Now, what name was I given?  Let me know the worst.
|Being the eldest son you were naturally christened after your father.
|Yes, but what was my father's Christian name?
|I cannot at the present moment recall what the General's Christian name was.
|But I have no doubt he had one.
|He was eccentric, I admit.
|But only in later years.
|And that was the result of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion,
|and other things of that kind.
|Algy!  Can't you recollect what our father's Christian name was?
|My dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms.
|He died before I was a year old.
|His name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose, Aunt Augusta?
|The General was essentially a man of peace, except in his domestic life.
|But I have no doubt his name would appear in any military directory.
|The Army Lists of the last forty years are here.
|These delightful records should have been my constant study.
|Generals M. Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley, what ghastly names they have,
|Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff!
|Lieutenant 1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, General 1869.
|Christian names: Ernest John.
|I always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn't I?
|Well, it is Ernest after all.  I mean it naturally is Ernest.
|Yes, I remember now that the General was called Ernest,
|I knew I had some particular reason for disliking the name.
|Ernest!  My own Ernest!
|I felt from the first that you could have no other name!
|Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly
|that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth.
|Can you forgive me?
|I can. For I feel that you are sure to change.
|My own one!
|Laetitia!
|Frederick! At last!
|Cecily! At last!
|Gwendolen! At last!
|My nephew, you seem to be displaying signs of triviality.
|On the contrary, Aunt Augusta,
|I've now realised for the first time in my life
|the vital Importance of Being Earnest.
