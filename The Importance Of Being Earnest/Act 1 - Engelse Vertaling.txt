|Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?
|I didn't think it polite to listen, sir.
|I'm sorry for that, for your sake. I don't play accurately --any one can play accurately --
|but I play with wonderful expression.
|As far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte.
|I keep science for Life.
|Yes, sir.
|And, speaking of the science of Life,
|have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?
|Yes, sir.
|Oh!... by the way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night,
|when Lord Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of champagne are entered as having been consumed.
|Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.
|Why is it that at a bachelor's establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne?
|I ask merely for information.
|I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir.
|I have often observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand.
|Good heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?
|I believe it IS a very pleasant state, sir.
|I have had very little experience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married once.
|That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and a young person.
|I don't know that I am much interested in your family life, Lane.
|No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it myself.
|Very natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.
|Thank you, sir.
|
|Lanes views on marriage seem somewhat lax.
|Really, if the lower orders don't set us a good example,
|what on earth is the use of them?
|They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.
|
|Mr. Ernest Worthing.
|How are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you up to town?
|Oh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as usual, I see, Algy!
|I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five o'clock.
|Where have you been since last Thursday?
|In the country.
|What on earth do you do there?
|When one is in town one amuses oneself. When one is in the country
|one amuses other people. It is excessively boring.
|And who are the people you amuse?
|Oh, neighbours, neighbours.
|Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?
|Perfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.
|How immensely you must amuse them!
|By the way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?
|Eh? Shropshire? Yes, of course.
|Hallo! Why all these cups? Why cucumber sandwiches?
|Why such reckless extravagance in one so young? Who is coming to tea?
|Oh! merely Aunt Augusta and
|Gwendolen.
|How perfectly delightful!
|Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won't quite approve of your being here.
|May I ask why?
|My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful.
|It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with...
|...you.
|I am in love with Gwendolen. I have come up to town expressly to propose to her.
|I thought you had come up for pleasure?... I call that business.
|How utterly unromantic you are!
|I really don't see anything romantic in proposing.
|It is very romantic to be in love.
|But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal. 
|Why, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe.
|Then the excitement is all over.
|The very essence of romance is uncertainty.
|If ever I get married, I'll certainly try to forget the fact.
|I have no doubt about that, dear Algy.
|The Divorce Court was specially invented for people
|whose memories are so curiously constituted.
|Oh! there is no use speculating on that subject.
|Divorces are made in Heaven --
|Please don't touch the cucumber sandwiches.
|They are ordered specially for Aunt Augusta.
|Well, you have been eating them all the time.
|That is quite a different matter. She is my aunt.
|Have some bread and butter. The bread and butter is for Gwendolen.
|Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.
|And very good bread and butter it is too.
|Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it all.
|You behave as if you were married to her already. 
|You are not married to her already, and I don't think you ever will be.
|Why on earth do you say that?
|Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with. Girls don't think it right.
|Oh, that is nonsense!
|It isn't. It is a great truth.
|It accounts for the extraordinary number of bachelors that one sees all over the place.
|In the second place, I don't give my consent.
|Your consent!
|My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin. And before I allow you to marry her,
|you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.
|Cecily! What on earth do you mean? What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily!
|I don't know any one of the name of Cecily.
|Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing
|left in the smoking room the last time he dined here.
|Yes, sir.
|Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?
|I wish to goodness you had let me know. I have been writing frantic letters to Scotland Yard about it.
|I was very nearly offering a large reward.
|Well, I wish you would offer one. I happen to be more than usually hard up.
|There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.
|I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say.
|However, it makes no matter, for,
|now that I look at the inscription inside, I find that the thing isn't yours after all.
|Of course it's mine.
|You have seen me with it a hundred times,
|and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written inside.
|It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case.
|Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule
|about what one should read and what one shouldn't. 
|More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn't read.
|I am quite aware of the fact, and I don't propose to discuss modern culture.
|It isn't the sort of thing one should talk of in private. I simply want my cigarette case back.
| Yes; but this isn't your cigarette case.
| This cigarette case is a present from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn't know any one of that name.
|Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.
|Your aunt!
|Yes. Charming old lady she is, too. Lives at Tunbridge Wells. Just give it back to me, Algy.
|But why does she call herself little Cecily if she is your aunt
|and lives at Tunbridge Wells?
|"From little Cecily with her fondest love."
|My dear fellow, what on earth is there in that?
|Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall.
|That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself.
|You seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt! That is absurd!
|For Heaven's sake give me back my cigarette case.
|Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle?
|'From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.'
|There is no objection, I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt,
|but why an aunt, no matter what her size may be,
|should call her own nephew her uncle, I can't quite make out.
|Besides, your name isn't Jack at all; it is Ernest.
|It isn't Ernest; it's Jack.
|You have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to every one as Ernest.
|You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your name was Ernest.
|You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in my life.
|It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn't Ernest. It's on your cards.
|Here is one of them. 'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.'
|I'll keep this as a proof that your name is Ernest
|if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to Gwendolen, or to any one else.
|Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the cigarette case was given to me in the country.
|Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt Cecily,
|who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle.
|Come, old boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.
|My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist.
|It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn't a dentist.
|It produces a false impression.
|Well, that is exactly what dentists always do. Now, go on! Tell me the whole thing.
|I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a confirmed and secret Bunburyist; 
|and I am quite sure of it now.
|Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?
|I'll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon as you are kind enough to inform me
|why you are Ernest in town and Jack in the country.
|Well, produce my cigarette case first.
|Here it is. Now produce your explanation, and pray make it improbable.
|My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about myexplanation at all. In fact it's perfectly ordinary.
|Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will
|guardian to his grand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew. 
|Cecily, who addresses me as her uncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate, 
|lives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable governess, Miss Prism.
|Where in that place in the country, by the way?
|That is nothing to you, dear boy. You are not going to be invited
|I may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.
|I suspected that, my dear fellow! I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire on two separate occasions. 
|Now, go on. Why are you Ernest in town and Jack in the country?
|My dear Algy, I don't know whether you will be able to understand my real motives.
|You are hardly serious enough. When one is placed in the position of guardian,
|one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects. 
|It's one's duty to do so.
|And as a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much to either one's health or one's happiness,
|in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother
| of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful scrapes. 
|That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple.
|The truth is rarely pure and never simple. 
|Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, 
|and modern literature a complete impossibility!
|That wouldn't be at all a bad thing.
|Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow. Don't try it.
|You should leave that to people who haven't been at a University.
|They do it so well in the daily papers. What you really are is a Bunburyist.
|I was quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist. You are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I know.
|What on earth do you mean?
|You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest,
|in order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like.
|I have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury,
| in order that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose. Bunbury is perfectly invaluable.
|If it wasn't for Bunbury's extraordinary bad health, for instance,
|I wouldn't be able to dine with you at Willis's to-night
|for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a week.
|I haven't asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.
|I know. You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations. 
|It is very foolish of you. Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving invitations.
|You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.
|I haven't the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind.
|To begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine with one's own relations.
|In the second place, whenever I do dine there I am always treated as a member of the family
|and sent down with either no woman at all, or two. 
|In the third place, I know perfectly well whom she will place me next to, to-night.
|She will place me next Mary Farquhar, 
|who always flirts with her own husband across the dinner-table.
|That is not very pleasant. Indeed, it is not even decent...
|and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase.
|The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous.
|It looks so bad. It is simply washing one's clean linen in public.
|Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying.
|I want to tell you the rules.
|I'm not a Bunburyist at all. If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to kill my brother,
|indeed I think I'll kill him in any case. Cecily is a little too much interested in him.
|It is rather a bore. So I am going to get rid of Ernest.
|And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr... with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.
|Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get married,
|which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad to know Bunbury.
|A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very tedious time of it.
|That is nonsense. If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen,
|and she is the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry,
|I certainly won't want to know Bunbury.
|Then your wife will. You don't seem to realise, that in married life
|three is company and two is none.
|That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been propounding
|for the last fifty years.
|Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.
|For heaven's sake, don't try to be cynical. It's perfectly easy to be cynical.
|My dear fellow, it isn't easy to be anything nowadays.
|There's such a lot of beastly competition about.
| Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta. Only relatives, or creditors, ever ring in that Wagnerian manner.
|Now, if I get her out of the way for ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to Gwendolen,
|may I dine with you to-night at Willis's?
|I suppose so, if you want to.
|Yes, but you must be serious about it. 
|I hate people who are not serious about meals. It is so shallow of them.
|Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.
|Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.
|I'm feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.
|That's not quite the same thing. In fact the two things rarely go together.
|Dear me, you are smart!
|I am always smart! Am I not, Mr. Worthing?
|You're quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.
|Oh! I hope I am not that. It would leave no room for developments,
|and I intend to develop in many directions.
|I'm sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was obliged to call on dear Lady Harbury. 
|I hadn't been there since her poor husband's death. 
|I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years younger.
|And now I'll have a cup of tea,
|and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches you promised me.
|Certainly, Aunt Augusta.
|Won't you come and sit here, Gwendolen?
|Thanks, mamma, I'm quite comfortable where I am.
|Good heavens! Lane! Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?
|I ordered them specially.
|There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir. I went down twice.
|No cucumbers!
|No, sir. Not even for ready money.
|That will do, Lane, thank you.
|Thank you, sir.
|I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers,
|not even for ready money.
|It really makes no matter, Algernon. I had some crumpets with Lady Harbury, 
|who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.
|I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.
|It certainly has changed its colour. From what cause I, of course, cannot say.
| Thank you. I've quite a treat for you to-night, Algernon.
|I am going to send you down with Mary Farquhar. 
|She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband. It's delightful to watch them.
|I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of dining with you to-night after all.
|I hope not, Algernon. It would put my table completely out.
|Your uncle would have to dine upstairs. Fortunately he is accustomed to that.
|It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment to me, 
|but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again.
|They seem to think I should be with him.
|It is very strange. This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad health.
|Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.
|Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury 
|made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die.
|This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd. 
|Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids.
|I consider it morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.
|Health is the primary duty of life.
|I am always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice...
|as far as any improvement in his ailment goes.
|I should be much obliged if you would ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough 
|not to have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me.
|It is my last reception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation
|particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically said whatever they had to say,
|which, in most cases, was probably not much.
|I'll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is stillconscious,
|and I think I can promise you he'll be all right by Saturday.
|Of course the music is a great difficulty. 
|You see, if one plays good music, people don't listen
|and if one plays bad music people don't talk.
|But I'll run over the programme I've drawn out
|if you will kindly come into the next room for a moment.
|Thank you, Algernon. It is very thoughtful of you.
|I'm sure the programme will be delightful, after a few expurgations.
|French songs I cannot possibly allow.
|People always seem to think that they are improper, 
|and either look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, which is worse. 
|But German sounds a thoroughly respectable language, and indeed, I believe is so. Gwendolen, you will accompany me.
|Certainly, mamma.
|Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.
|Pray don't talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing.
|Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they mean something else.
|And that makes me so nervous.
|I do mean something else.
|I thought so. In fact, I am never wrong.
|And I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady Bracknell's temporary absence...
|I would certainly advise you to do so. Mamma has a way of coming back suddenly into a room
|that I have often had to speak to her about.
|Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you more than any girl... 
|I have ever met since... I met you.
|Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact. 
|And I often wish that in public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative.
|For me you have always had an irresistible fascination.
|Even before I met you I was far from indifferent to you.
|We live, as I hope you know, Mr Worthing, in an age of ideals. 
|The fact is constantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines,
|and has reached the provincial pulpits, I am told;
|And my ideal has always been to love some one of the name of Ernest.
|There is something in that name that inspires absolute confidence.
|The moment Algernon first mentioned to me that he had a friend called Ernest,
|I knew I was destined to love you.
|You really love me, Gwendolen?
|Passionately!
|Darling! You don't know how happy you've made me.
|My own Ernest!
|But you don't really mean to say that you couldn't love me if my name wasn't Ernest?
|But your name is Ernest.
|Yes, I know it is. But supposing it was something else? Do you mean to say you couldn't love me then?
|Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like most metaphysical speculations has
|very little reference at all to the actual facts of real life, as we know them.
|Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don't much care about the name of Ernest...
|I don't think the name suits me at all.
|It suits you perfectly. It is a divine name.
|It has a music of its own. It produces vibrations.
|Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of other much nicer names. 
|I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.
|Jack?... No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at all, indeed.
|It does not thrill. It produces absolutely no vibrations...
|I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually plain.
|Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John! 
|And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John.
|She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moment's solitude.
|The only really safe name is Ernest
|Gwendolen, I must get christened at once
|-- I mean we must get married at once. There is no time to be lost.
|Married, Mr. Worthing?
|Well... surely. You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax,
|that you were not absolutely indifferent to me.
|I adore you. But you haven't proposed to me yet.
|Nothing has been said at all about marriage. The subject has not even been touched on.
|Well... may I propose to you now?
|I think it would be an admirable opportunity.
|And to spare you any possible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you 
|quite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.
|Gwendolen!
|Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?
|You know what I have got to say to you.
|Yes, but you don't say it.
|Gwendolen, will you marry me?
|Of course I will, darling. How long you have been about it!
|I am afraid you have had very little experience in how to propose.
|My own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.
|Yes, but men often propose for practice.
|I know my brother Gerald does.
|All my girl-friends tell me so. 
|What wonderfully blue eyes you have, Ernest! They are quite, quite, ...
|blue.
|I hope you will always look at me just like that, especially when there are other people present.
|Mr. Worthing! Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture.
|It is most indecorous.
|Mamma!
|I must beg you to retire. This is no place for you. 
|Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished yet.
|Finished what, may I ask?
|I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma.
|Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.
|When you do become engaged to some one, I, or your father,
|should his health permit him, will inform you of the fact.
|An engagement should come on a young girl as a surprise,
|pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be. 
|It is hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself...
|And now I have a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing.
|While I am making these inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the carriage.
|Mamma!
|In the carriage, Gwendolen!
|
|Gwendolen, the carriage!
|Yes, mamma.
|You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.
|Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.
|I feel bound to tell you that you are not down on my list of eligible young men,
|although I have the same list as the dear Duchess of Bolton has. 
|We work together, in fact.
|However, I am quite ready to enter your name, 
|should your answers be what a really affectionate mother requires. 
|Do you smoke?
|Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.
|I am glad to hear it. A man should always have an occupation of some kind.
|There are far too many idle men in London as it is.
|How old are you?
|Twenty-nine.
|A very good age to be married at. 
|I have always been of opinion that a man who desires to get married
|should know either everything or nothing. Which do you know?
|
|I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.
|I am pleased to hear it. 
|I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance.
|Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.
|The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound.
|Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever.
|If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes,
|and probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square.
|What is your income?
|Between seven and eight thousand a year.
|In land, or in investments?
|In investments, chiefly.
|That is satisfactory.
|What between the duties expected of one during one's lifetime,
|and the duties exacted from one after one's death, 
|land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure. 
|It gives one position, and prevents one from keeping it up.
|That's all that can be said about land.
|I have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about fifteen hundred acres
|but I don't depend on that for my real income.
|In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the only people who make anything out of it.
|A country house! How many bedrooms? 
|Well, that point can be cleared up afterwards.
|You have a town house, I hope?
|A girl with a simple, unspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, 
|could hardly be expected to reside in the country.
|Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to Lady Bloxham.
|Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six months' notice.
|Lady Bloxham? I don't know her.
|Oh, she goes about very little.
|She is a lady considerably advanced in years.
|Ah, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of character.
|What number in Belgrave Square?
|149.
|The unfashionable side. I thought there was something. 
|However, that could easily be altered.
|Do you mean the fashion, or the side?
|Both, if necessary, I presume. 
|What are your polities?
|Well, I am afraid I really have none. I am a Liberal Unionist.
|Oh, they count as Tories. They dine with us. 
|Or come in the evening, at any rate.
|Now to minor matters. Are your parents living?
|I have lost both my parents.
|To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune;
|to lose both looks like carelessness.
|Who was your father? 
|He was evidently a man of some wealth.
|Was he born in what the Radical papers call the purple of commerce,
|or did he rise from the ranks of the aristocracy?
|I am afraid I really don't know.
|The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I had lost my parents. 
|It would be nearer the truth to say that my parents
|seem to have lost me...
|I don't actually know who I am by birth. I was... 
|well, I was found.
|Found!
|The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and kindly disposition,
|found me, and gave me the name of Worthing,
|because he happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at the time.
|Worthing is a place in Sussex. It is a seaside resort.
|Where did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class ticket for this seaside resort find you?
|In a hand-bag.
|A hand-bag?
|Yes, Lady Bracknell. I was in a hand-bag
|A somewhat large, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it --
|an ordinary hand-bag in fact.
|In what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas Cardew
|come across this ordinary hand-bag?
|In the cloak-room at Victoria Station.
|It was given to him in mistake for his own.
|The cloak-room at Victoria Station?
|Yes. The Brighton line.
|The line is immaterial. 
|Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat bewildered by what you have just told me.
|To be born, or at any rate bred, in a hand-bag, 
|whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display a contempt
|for the ordinary decencies of family life that
|reminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution.
|And I presume you know what that unfortunate movement led to?
|As for the particular locality in which the hand-bag was found, 
|a cloak room at a railway station might serve
|to conceal a social indiscretion --
|has probably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now --
|but it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis 
|for a recognised position in good society.
|May I ask you then what you would advise me to do?
|I need hardly say I would do anything in the world
|to ensure Gwendolen's happiness.
|I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and acquire
|some relations as soon as possible, 
|and to make a definite effort to produce at any rate one parent,
|of either sex, before the season is quite over.
|Well, I don't see how I could possibly manage to do that.
|I can produce the hand-bag at any moment.
|It is in my dressing room at home.
|I really think that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.
|Me, sir! What has it to do with me? 
|You can hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would dream
|of allowing our only daughter -- a girl brought up with the utmost care --
|to marry into a cloak-room, 
|and form an alliance with a parcel? 
|Good morning, Mr. Worthing!
|Good morning!
|For goodness' sake don't play that ghastly tune, Algy.
|Didn't it go off all right, old boy?
|You don't mean to say Gwendolen refused you?
| I know it is a way she has. She is always refusing people.
|I think it is most ill-natured of her.
|Oh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet.
|As far as she is concerned, we are engaged.
|Her mother is perfectly unbearable. 
|Never met such a Gorgon...
|I don't really know what a Gorgon is like,
|but I am quite sure that Lady Bracknell is one.
|In any case, she is a monster, without being a myth, which is rather unfair.
|I beg your pardon, Algy, I suppose I shouldn't talk about your own aunt 
|in that way before you.
|My dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused.
|It is the only thing that makes me put up with them at all.
|Relations are simply a tedious pack of people,
|who haven't got the remotest knowledge of how to live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die.
|Oh, that is nonsense! 
|It isn't!
|Well, I won't argue about the matter. 
|You always want to argue about things.
|That is exactly what things were originally made for.
|Upon my word, if I thought that, I'd shoot myself...
|
|You don't think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother
|in about a hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?
|All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy.
|No man does. That's his.
|Is that clever?
|It is perfectly phrased!
|and quite as true as any observation in civilised life should be.
|I am sick to death of cleverness. Everybody is clever nowadays.
|You can't go anywhere without meeting clever people.
|The thing has become an absolute public nuisance. 
|I wish to goodness we had a few fools left.
|We have.
|I should extremely like to meet them. What do they talk about?
|The fools? Oh! about the clever people, of course.
|What fools!
|By the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being
|Ernest in town, and Jack in the country?
|My dear fellow, the truth isn't quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl. 
|What extraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!
|The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her,
|if she is pretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.
|Oh, that is nonsense.
|What about your brother? What about the profligate Ernest?
|Oh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him.
|I'll say he died in Paris of apoplexy. 
|Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite suddenly, don't they?
|Yes, but it's hereditary, my dear fellow. It's a sort of thing that runs in families.
|You had much better say a severe chill.
|You are sure a severe chill isn't hereditary, or anything of that kind?
|Of course it isn't!
|Very well, then. My poor brother Ernest to carried off suddenly, in Paris,
|by a severe chill. That gets rid of him.
|But I thought you said that... Miss Cardew was a little too much interested
|in your poor brother Ernest? Won't she feel his loss a good deal?
|Oh, that is all right. Cecily is not a silly romantic girl,
|I am glad to say. She has got a capital appetite,
|goes long walks, and pays no attention at all to her lessons.
|I would rather like to see Cecily.
|I will take very good care you never do. 
|She is excessively pretty, and she is only just eighteen.
|Have you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively pretty ward
|who is only just eighteen?
|Oh! one doesn't blurt these things out to people. 
|Cecily and Gwendolen are perfectly certain to be extremely great friends.
|I'll bet you anything you like that half an hour after they have met,
|they will be calling each other sister.
|Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of other things first.
|Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at Willis's
|we really must go and dress. Do you know it is nearly seven?
|It always is nearly seven.
|Well, I'm hungry.
|I never knew you when you weren't...
|What shall we do after dinner? Go to a theatre?
|Oh no! I loathe listening.
|Well, let us go to the Club?
|Oh, no! I hate talking.
|Well, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?
|Oh, no! I can't bear looking at things. It is so silly.
|Well, what shall we do?
|Nothing!
|It is awfully hard work doing nothing.
|However, I don't mind hard work where there is no definite object of any kind.
|Miss Fairfax.
|Gwendolen, upon my word!
|Algy, kindly turn your back. 
|I have something very particular to say to Mr. Worthing.
|Really, Gwendolen, I don't think I can allow this at all.
|Algy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards life.
|You are not quite old enough to do that.
|My own darling!
|Ernest, we may never be married.
|From the expression on mamma's face I fear we never shall.
|Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their children say to them.
|The old- fashioned respect for the young is fast dying out.
|Whatever influence I ever had over mamma, I lost at the age of three.
|But although she may prevent us from becoming man and wife,
|and I may marry some one else, and marry often, 
|nothing that she can possibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you.
|Dear Gwendolen!
|The story of your romantic origin, as related to me by mamma,
|with unpleasing comments, has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my nature.
|Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination.
|The simplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to me.
|Your town address at the Albany I have.
|What is your address in the country?
|The Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.
|There is a good postal service, I suppose? 
|It may be necessary to do something desperate. 
|That of course will require serious consideration. 
|I will communicate with you daily.
|My own one!
|How long do you remain in town?
|Till Monday.
|Good! Algy, you may turn round now.
|Thanks, I've turned round already.
|You may also ring the bell.
|You will let me see you to your carriage, my own darling?
|Certainly.
|I will see Miss Fairfax out.
|Yes, sir.
|A glass of sherry, Lane.
|Yes, sir.
|Tomorrow, Lane, I'm going Bunburying.
|Yes, sir.
|I shall probably not be back till Monday.
|You can put up my dress clothes, my smoking jacket, and all the Bunbury suits...
|Yes, sir.
|I hope tomorrow will be a fine day, Lane.
|It never is, sir.
|Lane, you're a perfect pessimist.
|I do my best to give satisfaction, sir.
|There's a sensible, intellectual girl!
|the only girl I ever cared for in my life.
|What on earth are you so amused at?
|Oh, I'm a little anxious about poor Bunbury, that in all.
|If you don't take care, your friend Bunbury will get you 
|into a serious scrape some day.
|I love scrapes. 
|They are the only things that are never serious.
|Oh, that's nonsense, Algy. You never talk anything but nonsense.
|Nobody ever does.
