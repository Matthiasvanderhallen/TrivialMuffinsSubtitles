|Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?
|I didn't think it polite to listen, sir.
|I'm sorry for that, for your sake. I don't play accurately --any one can play accurately --
|but I play with wonderful expression.
|As far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte.
|I keep science for Life.
|Yes, sir.
|And, speaking of the science of Life,
|have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?
|Yes, sir.
|Oh!... by the way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night,
|when Lord Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of champagne are entered as having been consumed.
|Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.
|Why is it that at a bachelor's establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne?
|I ask merely for information.
|I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir.
|I have often observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand.
|Good heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?
|I believe it IS a very pleasant state, sir.
|I have had very little experience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married once.
|That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and a young person.
|I don't know that I am much interested in your family life, Lane.
|No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it myself.
|Very natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.
|Thank you, sir.
|
|Lanes views on marriage seem somewhat lax.
|Really, if the lower orders don't set us a good example,
|what on earth is the use of them?
|They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.
|
|Mr. Ernest Worthing.
|How are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you up to town?
|Oh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as usual, I see, Algy!
|I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five o'clock.
|Where have you been since last Thursday?
|In the country.
|What on earth do you do there?
|When one is in town one amuses oneself. When one is in the country
|one amuses other people. It is excessively boring.
|And who are the people you amuse?
|Oh, neighbours, neighbours.
|Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?
|Perfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.
|How immensely you must amuse them!
|By the way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?
|Eh? Shropshire? Yes, of course.
|Hallo! Why all these cups? Why cucumber sandwiches?
|Why such reckless extravagance in one so young? Who is coming to tea?
|Oh! merely Aunt Augusta and
|Gwendolen.
|How perfectly delightful!
|Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won't quite approve of your being here.
|May I ask why?
|My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful.
|It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with...
|...you.
|I am in love with Gwendolen. I have come up to town expressly to propose to her.
|I thought you had come up for pleasure?... I call that business.
|How utterly unromantic you are!
|I really don't see anything romantic in proposing.
|It is very romantic to be in love.
|But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal. 
|Why, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe.
|Then the excitement is all over.
|The very essence of romance is uncertainty.
|If ever I get married, I'll certainly try to forget the fact.
|I have no doubt about that, dear Algy.
|The Divorce Court was specially invented for people
|whose memories are so curiously constituted.
|Oh! there is no use speculating on that subject.
|Divorces are made in Heaven --
|Please don't touch the cucumber sandwiches.
|They are ordered specially for Aunt Augusta.
|Well, you have been eating them all the time.
|That is quite a different matter. She is my aunt.
|Have some bread and butter. The bread and butter is for Gwendolen.
|Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.
|And very good bread and butter it is too.
|Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it all.
|You behave as if you were married to her already. 
|You are not married to her already, and I don't think you ever will be.
|Why on earth do you say that?
|Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with. Girls don't think it right.
|Oh, that is nonsense!
|It isn't. It is a great truth. It accounts for the extraordinary number of bachelors that one sees all over the place.
|In the second place, I don't give my consent.
|Your consent!
|My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin. And before I allow you to marry her,
|you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.
|Cecily! What on earth do you mean? What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily!
|I don't know any one of the name of Cecily.
|Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing
|left in the smoking room the last time he dined here.
|Yes, sir.
|Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?
|I wish to goodness you had let me know. I have been writing frantic letters to Scotland Yard about it.
|I was very nearly offering a large reward.
|Well, I wish you would offer one. I happen to be more than usually hard up.
|There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.
|I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say.
|However, it makes no matter, for,
|now that I look at the inscription inside, I find that the thing isn't yours after all.
|Of course it's mine.
|You have seen me with it a hundred times,
|and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written inside.
|It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case.
|Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule
|about what one should read and what one shouldn't. 
|More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn't read.
|I am quite aware of the fact, and I don't propose to discuss modern culture.
|It isn't the sort of thing one should talk of in private. I simply want my cigarette case back.
| Yes; but this isn't your cigarette case.
| This cigarette case is a present from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn't know any one of that name.
|Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.
|Your aunt!
|Yes. Charming old lady she is, too. Lives at Tunbridge Wells. Just give it back to me, Algy.
|But why does she call herself little Cecily if she is your aunt
|and lives at Tunbridge Wells?
|"From little Cecily with her fondest love."
|My dear fellow, what on earth is there in that?
|Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall.
|That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself.
|You seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt! That is absurd!
|For Heaven's sake give me back my cigarette case.



(Follows ALGERNON round the room)
ALGERNON
Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? 'From little
Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.' There is no objection, I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what her size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can't quite make out. Besides, your name isn't Jack at all; it is Ernest.
JACK It isn't Ernest; it's Jack.
ALGERNON
You have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you
to every one as Ernest. You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your name was Ernest. You are the most earnest- looking person I ever saw in my life. It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn't Ernest. It's on your cards. Here is one of them.
(Taking it from case)
'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.' I'll keep this as a proof that your name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to Gwendolen, or to any one else.
(Puts the card in his pocket)
JACK
Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and
the cigarette case was given to me in the country.
ALGERNON
Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small
Aunt Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle. Come, old boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.
JACK
My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist. It
is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn't a dentist. It produces a false impression,
