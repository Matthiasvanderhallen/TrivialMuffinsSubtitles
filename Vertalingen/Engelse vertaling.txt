|Did you hear what I was playing, Lane?
|I didn't think it polite to listen, sir.
|I'm sorry for that, for your sake. I don't play accurately --any one can play accurately --
|but I play with wonderful expression.
|As far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte.
|I keep science for Life.
|Yes, sir.
|And, speaking of the science of Life,
|have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?
|Yes, sir.
|Oh!... by the way, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night,
|when Lord Shoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of champagne are entered as having been consumed.
|Yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.
|Why is it that at a bachelor's establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne?
|I ask merely for information.
|I attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir.
|I have often observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand.
|Good heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?
|I believe it IS a very pleasant state, sir.
|I have had very little experience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married once.
|That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and a young person.
|I don't know that I am much interested in your family life, Lane.
|No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it myself.
|Very natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.
|Thank you, sir.
|
|Lanes views on marriage seem somewhat lax.
|Really, if the lower orders don't set us a good example,
|what on earth is the use of them?
|They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.
|
|Mr. Ernest Worthing.
|How are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you up to town?
|Oh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as usual, I see, Algy!
|I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five o'clock.
|Where have you been since last Thursday?
|In the country.
|What on earth do you do there?
|When one is in town one amuses oneself. When one is in the country
|one amuses other people. It is excessively boring.
|And who are the people you amuse?
|Oh, neighbours, neighbours.
|Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?
|Perfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.
|How immensely you must amuse them!
|By the way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?
|Eh? Shropshire? Yes, of course.
|Hallo! Why all these cups? Why cucumber sandwiches?
|Why such reckless extravagance in one so young? Who is coming to tea?
|Oh! merely Aunt Augusta and
|Gwendolen.
|How perfectly delightful!
|Yes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won't quite approve of your being here.
|May I ask why?
|My dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly disgraceful.
|It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with...
|...you.
|I am in love with Gwendolen. I have come up to town expressly to propose to her.
|I thought you had come up for pleasure?... I call that business.
|How utterly unromantic you are!
|I really don't see anything romantic in proposing.
|It is very romantic to be in love.
|But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.
|Why, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe.
|Then the excitement is all over.
|The very essence of romance is uncertainty.
|If ever I get married, I'll certainly try to forget the fact.
|I have no doubt about that, dear Algy.
|The Divorce Court was specially invented for people
|whose memories are so curiously constituted.
|Oh! there is no use speculating on that subject.
|Divorces are made in Heaven --
|Please don't touch the cucumber sandwiches.
|They are ordered specially for Aunt Augusta.
|Well, you have been eating them all the time.
|That is quite a different matter. She is my aunt.
|Have some bread and butter. The bread and butter is for Gwendolen.
|Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.
|And very good bread and butter it is too.
|Well, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it all.
|You behave as if you were married to her already.
|You are not married to her already, and I don't think you ever will be.
|Why on earth do you say that?
|Well, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with. Girls don't think it right.
|Oh, that is nonsense!
|It isn't. It is a great truth. It accounts for the extraordinary number of bachelors that one sees all over the place.
|In the second place, I don't give my consent.
|Your consent!
|My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin. And before I allow you to marry her,
|you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.
|Cecily! What on earth do you mean? What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily!
|I don't know any one of the name of Cecily.
|Bring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing
|left in the smoking room the last time he dined here.
|Yes, sir.
|Do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?
|I wish to goodness you had let me know. I have been writing frantic letters to Scotland Yard about it.
|I was very nearly offering a large reward.
|Well, I wish you would offer one. I happen to be more than usually hard up.
|There is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.
|I think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say.
|However, it makes no matter, for,
|now that I look at the inscription inside, I find that the thing isn't yours after all.
|Of course it's mine.
|You have seen me with it a hundred times,
|and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written inside.
|It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case.
|Oh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule
|about what one should read and what one shouldn't.
|More than half of modern culture depends on what one shouldn't read.
|I am quite aware of the fact, and I don't propose to discuss modern culture.
|It isn't the sort of thing one should talk of in private. I simply want my cigarette case back.
| Yes; but this isn't your cigarette case.
| This cigarette case is a present from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn't know any one of that name.
|Well, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.
|Your aunt!
|Yes. Charming old lady she is, too. Lives at Tunbridge Wells. Just give it back to me, Algy.
|But why does she call herself little Cecily if she is your aunt
|and lives at Tunbridge Wells?
|"From little Cecily with her fondest love."
|My dear fellow, what on earth is there in that?
|Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall.
|That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself.
|You seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt! That is absurd!
|For Heaven's sake give me back my cigarette case.
|Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle?
|'From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.'
|There is no objection, I admit, to an aunt being a small aunt,
|but why an aunt, no matter what her size may be,
|should call her own nephew her uncle, I can't quite make out.
|Besides, your name isn't Jack at all; it is Ernest.
|It isn't Ernest; it's Jack.
|You have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to every one as Ernest.
|You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your name was Ernest.
|You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in my life.
|It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn't Ernest. It's on your cards.
|Here is one of them. 'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.'
|I'll keep this as a proof that your name is Ernest
|if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to Gwendolen, or to any one else.
|Well, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the cigarette case was given to me in the country.
|Yes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt Cecily,
|who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle.
|Come, old boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.
|My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist.
|It is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn't a dentist.
|It produces a false impression.
|Well, that is exactly what dentists always do. Now, go on! Tell me the whole thing.
|I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a confirmed and secret Bunburyist;
|and I am quite sure of it now.
|Bunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?
|I'll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon as you are kind enough to inform me
|why you are Ernest in town and Jack in the country.
|Well, produce my cigarette case first.
|Here it is. Now produce your explanation, and pray make it improbable.
|My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about myexplanation at all. In fact it's perfectly ordinary.
|Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will
|guardian to his grand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew.
|Cecily, who addresses me as her uncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate,
|lives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable governess, Miss Prism.
|Where in that place in the country, by the way?
|That is nothing to you, dear boy. You are not going to be invited
|I may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.
|I suspected that, my dear fellow! I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire on two separate occasions.
|Now, go on. Why are you Ernest in town and Jack in the country?
|My dear Algy, I don't know whether you will be able to understand my real motives.
|You are hardly serious enough. When one is placed in the position of guardian,
|one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects.
|It's one's duty to do so.
|And as a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much to either one's health or one's happiness,
|in order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger brother
| of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into the most dreadful scrapes.
|That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure and simple.
|The truth is rarely pure and never simple.
|Modern life would be very tedious if it were either,
|and modern literature a complete impossibility!
|That wouldn't be at all a bad thing.
|Literary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow. Don't try it.
|You should leave that to people who haven't been at a University.
|They do it so well in the daily papers. What you really are is a Bunburyist.
|I was quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist. You are one of the most advanced Bunburyists I know.
|What on earth do you mean?
|You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest,
|in order that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like.
|I have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury,
| in order that I may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose. Bunbury is perfectly invaluable.
|If it wasn't for Bunbury's extraordinary bad health, for instance,
|I wouldn't be able to dine with you at Willis's to-night
|for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a week.
|I haven't asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.
|I know. You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations.
|It is very foolish of you. Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving invitations.
|You had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.
|I haven't the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind.
|To begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to dine with one's own relations.
|In the second place, whenever I do dine there I am always treated as a member of the family
|and sent down with either no woman at all, or two.
|In the third place, I know perfectly well whom she will place me next to, to-night.
|She will place me next Mary Farquhar,
|who always flirts with her own husband across the dinner-table.
|That is not very pleasant. Indeed, it is not even decent...
|and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase.
|The amount of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous.
|It looks so bad. It is simply washing one's clean linen in public.
|Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying.
|I want to tell you the rules.
|I'm not a Bunburyist at all. If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to kill my brother,
|indeed I think I'll kill him in any case. Cecily is a little too much interested in him.
|It is rather a bore. So I am going to get rid of Ernest.
|And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr... with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.
|Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get married,
|which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad to know Bunbury.
|A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very tedious time of it.
|That is nonsense. If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen,
|and she is the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry,
|I certainly won't want to know Bunbury.
|Then your wife will. You don't seem to realise, that in married life
|three is company and two is none.
|That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been propounding
|for the last fifty years.
|Yes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.
|For heaven's sake, don't try to be cynical. It's perfectly easy to be cynical.
|My dear fellow, it isn't easy to be anything nowadays.
|There's such a lot of beastly competition about.
| Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta. Only relatives, or creditors, ever ring in that Wagnerian manner.
|Now, if I get her out of the way for ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to Gwendolen,
|may I dine with you to-night at Willis's?
|I suppose so, if you want to.
|Yes, but you must be serious about it.
|I hate people who are not serious about meals. It is so shallow of them.
|Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.
|Good afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.
|I'm feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.
|That's not quite the same thing. In fact the two things rarely go together.
|Dear me, you are smart!
|I am always smart! Am I not, Mr. Worthing?
|You're quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.
|Oh! I hope I am not that. It would leave no room for developments,
|and I intend to develop in many directions.
|I'm sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was obliged to call on dear Lady Harbury.
|I hadn't been there since her poor husband's death.
|I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years younger.
|And now I'll have a cup of tea,
|and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches you promised me.
|Certainly, Aunt Augusta.
|Won't you come and sit here, Gwendolen?
|Thanks, mamma, I'm quite comfortable where I am.
|Good heavens! Lane! Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?
|I ordered them specially.
|There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir. I went down twice.
|No cucumbers!
|No, sir. Not even for ready money.
|That will do, Lane, thank you.
|Thank you, sir.
|I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers,
|not even for ready money.
|It really makes no matter, Algernon. I had some crumpets with Lady Harbury,
|who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.
|I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.
|It certainly has changed its colour. From what cause I, of course, cannot say.
| Thank you. I've quite a treat for you to-night, Algernon.
|I am going to send you down with Mary Farquhar.
|She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband. It's delightful to watch them.
|I am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of dining with you to-night after all.
|I hope not, Algernon. It would put my table completely out.
|Your uncle would have to dine upstairs. Fortunately he is accustomed to that.
|It is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment to me,
|but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend Bunbury is very ill again.
|They seem to think I should be with him.
|It is very strange. This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad health.
|Yes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.
|Well, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr. Bunbury
|made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die.
|This shilly-shallying with the question is absurd.
|Nor do I in any way approve of the modern sympathy with invalids.
|I consider it morbid. Illness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.
|Health is the primary duty of life.
|I am always telling that to your poor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice...
|as far as any improvement in his ailment goes.
|I should be much obliged if you would ask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough
|not to have a relapse on Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me.
|It is my last reception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation
|particularly at the end of the season when every one has practically said whatever they had to say,
|which, in most cases, was probably not much.
|I'll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is stillconscious,
|and I think I can promise you he'll be all right by Saturday.
|Of course the music is a great difficulty.
|You see, if one plays good music, people don't listen
|and if one plays bad music people don't talk.
|But I'll run over the programme I've drawn out
|if you will kindly come into the next room for a moment.
|Thank you, Algernon. It is very thoughtful of you.
|I'm sure the programme will be delightful, after a few expurgations.
|French songs I cannot possibly allow.
|People always seem to think that they are improper,
|and either look shocked, which is vulgar, or laugh, which is worse.
|But German sounds a thoroughly respectable language, and indeed, I believe is so. Gwendolen, you will accompany me.
|Certainly, mamma.
|Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.
|Pray don't talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing.
|Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they mean something else.
|And that makes me so nervous.
|I do mean something else.
|I thought so. In fact, I am never wrong.
|And I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady Bracknell's temporary absence...
|I would certainly advise you to do so. Mamma has a way of coming back suddenly into a room
|that I have often had to speak to her about.
|Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you more than any girl...
|I have ever met since... I met you.
|Yes, I am quite well aware of the fact.
|And I often wish that in public, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative.
|For me you have always had an irresistible fascination.
|Even before I met you I was far from indifferent to you.
|We live, as I hope you know, Mr Worthing, in an age of ideals.
|The fact is constantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines,
|and has reached the provincial pulpits, I am told;
|And my ideal has always been to love some one of the name of Ernest.
|There is something in that name that inspires absolute confidence.
|The moment Algernon first mentioned to me that he had a friend called Ernest,
|I knew I was destined to love you.
|You really love me, Gwendolen?
|Passionately!
|Darling! You don't know how happy you've made me.
|My own Ernest!
|But you don't really mean to say that you couldn't love me if my name wasn't Ernest?
|But your name is Ernest.
|Yes, I know it is. But supposing it was something else? Do you mean to say you couldn't love me then?
|Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like most metaphysical speculations has
|very little reference at all to the actual facts of real life, as we know them.
|Personally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don't much care about the name of Ernest...
|I don't think the name suits me at all.
|It suits you perfectly. It is a divine name.
|It has a music of its own. It produces vibrations.
|Well, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of other much nicer names.
|I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.
|Jack?... No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at all, indeed.
|It does not thrill. It produces absolutely no vibrations...
|I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were more than usually plain.
|Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for John!
|And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John.
|She would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single moment's solitude.
|The only really safe name is Ernest
|Gwendolen, I must get christened at once
|-- I mean we must get married at once. There is no time to be lost.
|Married, Mr. Worthing?
|Well... surely. You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax,
|that you were not absolutely indifferent to me.
|I adore you. But you haven't proposed to me yet.
|Nothing has been said at all about marriage. The subject has not even been touched on.
|Well... may I propose to you now?
|I think it would be an admirable opportunity.
|And to spare you any possible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you
|quite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.
|Gwendolen!
|Yes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?
|You know what I have got to say to you.
|Yes, but you don't say it.
|Gwendolen, will you marry me?
|Of course I will, darling. How long you have been about it!
|I am afraid you have had very little experience in how to propose.
|My own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.
|Yes, but men often propose for practice.
|I know my brother Gerald does.
|All my girl-friends tell me so.
|What wonderfully blue eyes you have, Ernest! They are quite, quite, ...
|blue.
|I hope you will always look at me just like that, especially when there are other people present.
|Mr. Worthing! Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture.
|It is most indecorous.
|Mamma!
|I must beg you to retire. This is no place for you.
|Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished yet.
|Finished what, may I ask?
|I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma.
|Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.
|When you do become engaged to some one, I, or your father,
|should his health permit him, will inform you of the fact.
|An engagement should come on a young girl as a surprise,
|pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be.
|It is hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself...
|And now I have a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing.
|While I am making these inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the carriage.
|Mamma!
|In the carriage, Gwendolen!
|
|Gwendolen, the carriage!
|Yes, mamma.
|You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.
|Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.
|I feel bound to tell you that you are not down on my list of eligible young men,
|although I have the same list as the dear Duchess of Bolton has.
|We work together, in fact.
|However, I am quite ready to enter your name,
|should your answers be what a really affectionate mother requires.
|Do you smoke?
|Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.
|I am glad to hear it. A man should always have an occupation of some kind.
|There are far too many idle men in London as it is.
|How old are you?
|Twenty-nine.
|A very good age to be married at.
|I have always been of opinion that a man who desires to get married
|should know either everything or nothing. Which do you know?
|
|I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.
|I am pleased to hear it.
|I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural ignorance.
|Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it and the bloom is gone.
|The whole theory of modern education is radically unsound.
|Fortunately in England, at any rate, education produces no effect whatsoever.
|If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes,
|and probably lead to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square.
|What is your income?
|Between seven and eight thousand a year.
|In land, or in investments?
|In investments, chiefly.
|That is satisfactory.
|What between the duties expected of one during one's lifetime,
|and the duties exacted from one after one's death,
|land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure.
|It gives one position, and prevents one from keeping it up.
|That's all that can be said about land.
|I have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about fifteen hundred acres
|but I don't depend on that for my real income.
|In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the only people who make anything out of it.
|A country house! How many bedrooms?
|Well, that point can be cleared up afterwards.
|You have a town house, I hope?
|A girl with a simple, unspoiled nature, like Gwendolen,
|could hardly be expected to reside in the country.
|Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to Lady Bloxham.
|Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six months' notice.
|Lady Bloxham? I don't know her.
|Oh, she goes about very little.
|She is a lady considerably advanced in years.
|Ah, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of character.
|What number in Belgrave Square?
|149.
|The unfashionable side. I thought there was something.
|However, that could easily be altered.
|Do you mean the fashion, or the side?
|Both, if necessary, I presume.
|What are your polities?
|Well, I am afraid I really have none. I am a Liberal Unionist.
|Oh, they count as Tories. They dine with us.
|Or come in the evening, at any rate.
|Now to minor matters. Are your parents living?
|I have lost both my parents.
|To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune;
|to lose both looks like carelessness.
|Who was your father?
|He was evidently a man of some wealth.
|Was he born in what the Radical papers call the purple of commerce,
|or did he rise from the ranks of the aristocracy?
|I am afraid I really don't know.
|The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I had lost my parents.
|It would be nearer the truth to say that my parents
|seem to have lost me...
|I don't actually know who I am by birth. I was...
|well, I was found.
|Found!
|The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and kindly disposition,
|found me, and gave me the name of Worthing,
|because he happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at the time.
|Worthing is a place in Sussex. It is a seaside resort.
|Where did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class ticket for this seaside resort find you?
|In a hand-bag.
|A hand-bag?
|Yes, Lady Bracknell. I was in a hand-bag
|A somewhat large, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it --
|an ordinary hand-bag in fact.
|In what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas Cardew
|come across this ordinary hand-bag?
|In the cloak-room at Victoria Station.
|It was given to him in mistake for his own.
|The cloak-room at Victoria Station?
|Yes. The Brighton line.
|The line is immaterial.
|Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat bewildered by what you have just told me.
|To be born, or at any rate bred, in a hand-bag,
|whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display a contempt
|for the ordinary decencies of family life that
|reminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution.
|And I presume you know what that unfortunate movement led to?
|As for the particular locality in which the hand-bag was found,
|a cloak room at a railway station might serve
|to conceal a social indiscretion --
|has probably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now --
|but it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis
|for a recognised position in good society.
|May I ask you then what you would advise me to do?
|I need hardly say I would do anything in the world
|to ensure Gwendolen's happiness.
|I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and acquire
|some relations as soon as possible,
|and to make a definite effort to produce at any rate one parent,
|of either sex, before the season is quite over.
|Well, I don't see how I could possibly manage to do that.
|I can produce the hand-bag at any moment.
|It is in my dressing room at home.
|I really think that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.
|Me, sir! What has it to do with me?
|You can hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell would dream
|of allowing our only daughter -- a girl brought up with the utmost care --
|to marry into a cloak-room,
|and form an alliance with a parcel?
|Good morning, Mr. Worthing!
|Good morning!
|For goodness' sake don't play that ghastly tune, Algy.
|Didn't it go off all right, old boy?
|You don't mean to say Gwendolen refused you?
| I know it is a way she has. She is always refusing people.
|I think it is most ill-natured of her.
|Oh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet.
|As far as she is concerned, we are engaged.
|Her mother is perfectly unbearable.
|Never met such a Gorgon...
|I don't really know what a Gorgon is like,
|but I am quite sure that Lady Bracknell is one.
|In any case, she is a monster, without being a myth, which is rather unfair.
|I beg your pardon, Algy, I suppose I shouldn't talk about your own aunt
|in that way before you.
|My dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused.
|It is the only thing that makes me put up with them at all.
|Relations are simply a tedious pack of people,
|who haven't got the remotest knowledge of how to live, nor the smallest instinct about when to die.
|Oh, that is nonsense!
|It isn't!
|Well, I won't argue about the matter.
|You always want to argue about things.
|That is exactly what things were originally made for.
|Upon my word, if I thought that, I'd shoot myself...
|
|You don't think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother
|in about a hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?
|All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy.
|No man does. That's his.
|Is that clever?
|It is perfectly phrased!
|and quite as true as any observation in civilised life should be.
|I am sick to death of cleverness. Everybody is clever nowadays.
|You can't go anywhere without meeting clever people.
|The thing has become an absolute public nuisance.
|I wish to goodness we had a few fools left.
|We have.
|I should extremely like to meet them. What do they talk about?
|The fools? Oh! about the clever people, of course.
|What fools!
|By the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being
|Ernest in town, and Jack in the country?
|My dear fellow, the truth isn't quite the sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl.
|What extraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!
|The only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her,
|if she is pretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.
|Oh, that is nonsense.
|What about your brother? What about the profligate Ernest?
|Oh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him.
|I'll say he died in Paris of apoplexy.
|Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite suddenly, don't they?
|Yes, but it's hereditary, my dear fellow. It's a sort of thing that runs in families.
|You had much better say a severe chill.
|You are sure a severe chill isn't hereditary, or anything of that kind?
|Of course it isn't!
|Very well, then. My poor brother Ernest to carried off suddenly, in Paris,
|by a severe chill. That gets rid of him.
|But I thought you said that... Miss Cardew was a little too much interested
|in your poor brother Ernest? Won't she feel his loss a good deal?
|Oh, that is all right. Cecily is not a silly romantic girl,
|I am glad to say. She has got a capital appetite,
|goes long walks, and pays no attention at all to her lessons.
|I would rather like to see Cecily.
|I will take very good care you never do.
|She is excessively pretty, and she is only just eighteen.
|Have you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively pretty ward
|who is only just eighteen?
|Oh! one doesn't blurt these things out to people.
|Cecily and Gwendolen are perfectly certain to be extremely great friends.
|I'll bet you anything you like that half an hour after they have met,
|they will be calling each other sister.
|Women only do that when they have called each other a lot of other things first.
|Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at Willis's
|we really must go and dress. Do you know it is nearly seven?
|It always is nearly seven.
|Well, I'm hungry.
|I never knew you when you weren't...
|What shall we do after dinner? Go to a theatre?
|Oh no! I loathe listening.
|Well, let us go to the Club?
|Oh, no! I hate talking.
|Well, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?
|Oh, no! I can't bear looking at things. It is so silly.
|Well, what shall we do?
|Nothing!
|It is awfully hard work doing nothing.
|However, I don't mind hard work where there is no definite object of any kind.
|Miss Fairfax.
|Gwendolen, upon my word!
|Algy, kindly turn your back.
|I have something very particular to say to Mr. Worthing.
|Really, Gwendolen, I don't think I can allow this at all.
|Algy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards life.
|You are not quite old enough to do that.
|My own darling!
|Ernest, we may never be married.
|From the expression on mamma's face I fear we never shall.
|Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their children say to them.
|The old- fashioned respect for the young is fast dying out.
|Whatever influence I ever had over mamma, I lost at the age of three.
|But although she may prevent us from becoming man and wife,
|and I may marry some one else, and marry often,
|nothing that she can possibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you.
|Dear Gwendolen!
|The story of your romantic origin, as related to me by mamma,
|with unpleasing comments, has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my nature.
|Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination.
|The simplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to me.
|Your town address at the Albany I have.
|What is your address in the country?
|The Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.
|There is a good postal service, I suppose?
|It may be necessary to do something desperate.
|That of course will require serious consideration.
|I will communicate with you daily.
|My own one!
|How long do you remain in town?
|Till Monday.
|Good! Algy, you may turn round now.
|Thanks, I've turned round already.
|You may also ring the bell.
|You will let me see you to your carriage, my own darling?
|Certainly.
|I will see Miss Fairfax out.
|Yes, sir.
|A glass of sherry, Lane.
|Yes, sir.
|Tomorrow, Lane, I'm going Bunburying.
|Yes, sir.
|I shall probably not be back till Monday.
|You can put up my dress clothes, my smoking jacket, and all the Bunbury suits...
|Yes, sir.
|I hope tomorrow will be a fine day, Lane.
|It never is, sir.
|Lane, you're a perfect pessimist.
|I do my best to give satisfaction, sir.
|There's a sensible, intellectual girl!
|the only girl I ever cared for in my life.
|What on earth are you so amused at?
|Oh, I'm a little anxious about poor Bunbury, that in all.
|If you don't take care, your friend Bunbury will get you
|into a serious scrape some day.
|I love scrapes.
|They are the only things that are never serious.
|Oh, that's nonsense, Algy. You never talk anything but nonsense.
|Nobody ever does.



|The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one else would have done
|seems to me to show that they have some sense of shame left.
|They have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.
|
|They don't seem to notice us at all. Couldn't you cough?
|But I haven't got a cough.
|They're looking at us. What effrontery!
|They're approaching. That's very forward of them.
|Let us preserve a dignified silence.
|Certainly. It's the only thing to do now.
|
|This dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect.
|A most distasteful one.
|But we will not be the first to speak.
|Certainly not.
|
|Mr. Worthing, I have something very particular to ask you.
|Much depends on your reply.
|Gwendolen, your common sense is invaluable.
|Mr. Moncrieff, kindly answer me the following question.
|Why did you pretend to be my guardian's brother?
|In order that I might have an opportunity of meeting you.
|That certainly seems a satisfactory explanation, does it not?
|Yes, dear, if you can believe him.
|I don't.
|But that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer.
|True. In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.
| Mr. Worthing, what explanation can you offer to me for pretending to have a brother?
|Was it in order that you might have an opportunity of coming up to town to see me as often as possible?
|Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?
|I have the gravest doubts upon the subject. But I intend to crush them.
|This is not the moment for German scepticism.
|Their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory, especially Mr. Worthing's.
|That seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it.
|I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said. His voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity.
|Then you think we should forgive them?
|Yes.
|I mean no.
|True! I had forgotten.
|There are principles at stake that one cannot surrender.
|Which of us should tell them? The task is not a pleasant one.
|Could we not both speak at the same time?
|An excellent idea! I nearly always speak at the same time as other people.
|Will you take the time from me?
|Certainly.
| Your Christian names are still an insuperable barrier. That is all!
|Our Christian names! Is that all? But we are going to be christened this afternoon.
|For my sake you are prepared to do this terrible thing?
|I am.
|To please me you are ready to face this fearful ordeal?
|I am!
|How absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes!
|Where questions of self-sacrifice are concerned, men are infinitely beyond us.
|We are.
|They have moments of physical courage of which we women know absolutely nothing.
|Darling!
|Darling!
|
|Ahem! Ahem! Lady Bracknell!
|Good heavens!
|Gwendolen! What does this mean?
|Merely that I am engaged to be married to Mr. Worthing, mamma.
|Come here. Sit down.
|Sit down immediately.
|Hesitation of any kind is a sign of mental decay in the young,
|of physical weakness in the old.
|Apprised, sir, of my daughter's sudden flight by her trusty maid
|whose confidence I purchased by means of a small coin
|I followed her at once by a luggage train.
|Her unhappy father is, I am glad to say, under the impression
|that she is attending a more than usually lengthy lecture
|by the University Extension Scheme on the Influence of a permanent income on Thought.
|I do not propose to undeceive him. Indeed I have never undeceived him on any question.
|I would consider it wrong.
|But of course, you will clearly understand that all communication
|between yourself and my daughter must cease immediately from this moment.
|On this point, as indeed on all points, I am firm.
|I am engaged to be married to Gwendolen Lady Bracknell!
|You are nothing of the kind, sir. And now, as regards Algernon!
|
|Algernon!
|Yes, Aunt Augusta.
|May I ask if it is in this house that your invalid friend Mr. Bunbury resides?
|Oh! No! Bunbury doesn't live here. Bunbury is somewhere else at present.
|In fact,
|Bunbury is dead.
|Dead! When did Mr. Bunbury die? His death must have been extremely sudden.
|Oh! I killed Bunbury this afternoon..
|I mean... poor Bunbury died this afternoon.
|What did he die of?
|Bunbury? Oh, he was quite...
|exploded.
|Exploded! Was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage?
|I was not aware that Mr. Bunbury was interested in social legislation.
|If so, he is well punished for his morbidity.
|My dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out!
|The doctors found out that Bunbury could not live, that is what I mean
|so Bunbury died.
|He seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of his physicians.
|I am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some definite course of action,
|and acted under proper medical advice.
|And now that we have finally got rid of this Mr. Bunbury, may I ask, Mr. Worthing,
|who is that young person whose hand my nephew Algernon is now holding
|in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?
|That lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward.
|I am engaged to be married to Cecily, Aunt Augusta.
|I beg your pardon?
|Mr. Moncrieff and I are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.
|I do not know whether there is anything peculiarly exciting
|in the air of this particular part of Hertfordshire,
|but the number of engagements that go on seems to me considerably
|above the proper average that statistics have laid down for our guidance.
|I think some preliminary inquiry on my part would not be out of place.
|Mr. Worthing, is Miss Cardew at all connected
|with any of the larger railway stations in London?
|I merely desire information.
|Until yesterday I had no idea that there were any families or persons
|whose origin was a Terminus.
|Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter of the late Mr. Thomas Cardew of
|149 Belgrave Square, S.W.;
|Gervase Park, Dorking, Surrey;
|and the Sporran, Fifeshire, N.B.
|That sounds not unsatisfactory. Three addresses always inspire confidence, even in tradesmen.
|But what proof have I of their authenticity?
|I have carefully preserved the Court Guides of the period. They are open to your inspection, Lady Bracknell.
|I have known strange errors in that publication.
|Miss Cardew's family solicitors are Messrs. Markby, Markby, and Markby.
|Markby, Markby, and Markby?
|A firm of the very highest position in their profession.
|Indeed I am told that one of the Mr. Markby's is occasionally to be seen at dinner parties.
|So far I am satisfied.
|How extremely kind of you, Lady Bracknell!
|I have also in my possession, you will be pleased to hear,
|certificates of Miss Cardew's birth, baptism, whooping cough,
|registration, vaccination, confirmation, and the measles;
|both the German and the English variety.
|Ah! A life crowded with incident, I see;
|though perhaps somewhat too exciting for a young girl.
|I am not myself in favour of premature experiences.
|Gwendolen! the time approaches for our departure. We have not a moment to lose.
|As a matter of form, Mr. Worthing, I had better ask you if Miss Cardew has any little fortune?
|Oh! about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the Funds. That is all. Goodbye,
|So pleased to have seen you.
|A moment, Mr. Worthing. A hundred and thirty thousand pounds! And in the Funds!
|Miss Cardew seems to me a most attractive young lady, now that I look at her.
|Few girls of the present day have any really solid qualities,
|any of the qualities that last, and improve with time.
|We live, I regret to say, in an age of surfaces.
|Come over here, dear.
|
|Pretty child! your dress is sadly simple,
|and your hair seems almost as Nature might have left it.
|But we can soon alter all that.
|A thoroughly experienced French maid produces a really marvellous result
|in a very brief space of time.
|I remember recommending one to young Lady Lancing,
|and after three months her own husband did not know her.
|And after six months nobody knew her.
|Kindly turn round, sweet child.
|
|No, the side view is what I want.
|Yes, quite as I expected.
|There are distinct social possibilities in your profile.
|The two weak points in our age are its want of principle and its want of profile.
|The chin a little higher, dear.
|Style largely depends on the way the chin is worn.
|They are worn very high, just at present.
|Algernon!
|Yes, Aunt Augusta!
|There are distinct social possibilities in Miss Cardew's profile.
|Cecily is the sweetest, dearest, prettiest girl in the whole world.
|And I don't care twopence about social possibilities.
|Never speak disrespectfully of Society,
|Only people who can't get into it do that.
|Dear child, of course you know that Algernon has nothing but his debts to depend upon.
|But I do not approve of mercenary marriages.
|When I married Lord Bracknell I had no fortune of any kind.
|But I never dreamed for a moment of allowing that to stand in my way.
|Well, I suppose I must give my consent.
|Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
|Cecily, you may kiss me!
|Thank you, Lady Bracknell.
|You may also address me as Aunt Augusta for the future.
|Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
|The marriage, I think, had better take place quite soon.
|Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
|Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
|To speak frankly, I am not in favour of long engagements.
|They give people the opportunity of finding out each other's character before marriage,
|which I think is never advisable.
|I beg your pardon for interrupting you, Lady Bracknell,
|but this engagement is quite out of the question.
|I am Miss Cardew's guardian,
|and she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age.
|That consent I absolutely decline to give.
|Upon what grounds may I ask?
|Algernon is an extremely, I may almost say an ostentatiously, eligible young man.
|He has nothing, but he looks everything. What more can one desire?
|It pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you, Lady Bracknell, about your nephew,
|but the fact is that I do not approve at all of his moral character.
|I suspect him of being untruthful.
|Untruthful! My nephew Algernon? Impossible! He is an Oxonian.
|I fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter.
|This afternoon during my temporary absence in London on an important question of romance,
|he obtained admission to my house by means of the false pretence of being my brother.
|Under an assumed name he drank, I've just been informed by my butler,
|an entire pint bottle of my Perrier-Jouet, Brut, '89; wine I was specially reserving for myself.
|Continuing his disgraceful deception,
|he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienating the affections of my only ward.
|He subsequently stayed to tea, and devoured every single muffin.
|And what makes his conduct all the more heartless is,
|that he was perfectly well aware from the first that I have no brother,
|that I never had a brother, and that I don't intend to have a brother,
|not even of any kind. I distinctly told him so myself yesterday afternoon.
|Ahem! Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration
|I have decided entirely to overlook my nephew's conduct to you.
|That is very generous of you,
|My own decision, however, is unalterable. I decline to give my consent.
|Come here, sweet child.
|How old are you, dear?
|Well, I am really only eighteen, but I always admit to twenty when I go to evening parties.
|You are perfectly right in making some slight alteration.
|Indeed, no woman should ever be quite accurate about her age. It looks so calculating...
|Eighteen, but admitting to twenty at evening parties.
|Well, it will not be very long before you are of age and free from the restraints of tutelage.
|So I don't think your guardian's consent is, after all, a matter of any importance.
|Pray excuse me, Lady Bracknell, for interrupting you again,
|but it is only fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather's will
|Miss Cardew does not come legally of age till she is thirty-five.
|That does not seem to me to be a grave objection. Thirty-five is a very attractive age.
|London society is full of women of the very highest birth who have, of their own free choice,
|remained thirty-five for years. Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point.
|To my own knowledge she has been thirty-five ever since she arrived at the age of forty,
|which was many years ago now.
|I see no reason why our dear Cecily should not be even still more attractive
|at the age you mention than she is at present. There will be a large accumulation of property.
|Algy, could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?
|Of course I could,
|You know I could.
|Yes, I felt it instinctively, but I couldn't wait all that time.
|I hate waiting even five minutes for anybody. It always makes me rather cross.
|I am not punctual myself, I know, but I do like punctuality in others,
|and waiting, even to be married, is quite out of the question.
|Then what is to be done, Cecily?
|I don't know, Mr. Moncrieff.
|My dear Mr. Worthing, as Miss Cardew states positively
|that she cannot wait till she is thirty-five,
|a remark which I am bound to say seems to me to show a somewhat impatient nature,
|I would beg of you to reconsider your decision.
|But my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is entirely in your own hands.
|The moment you consent to my marriage with Gwendolen,
|I will most gladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward.
|You must be quite aware that what you propose is out of the question.
|Then a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward to.
|That is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen.
|Algernon, of course, can choose for himself.
|Come, dear, we have already missed five, if not six, trains.
|To miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform.
|Everything is quite ready for the christenings.
|The christenings, sir!  Is not that somewhat premature?
|Both these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism.
|At their age?  The idea is grotesque and irreligious!
|Algernon, I forbid you to be baptized.  I will not hear of such excesses.
|Lord Bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned
|that that was the way in which you wasted your time and money.
|Am I to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all this afternoon?
|I don't think that, as things are now,
|it would be of much practical value to either of us, Dr. Chasuble.
|I am grieved to hear such sentiments from you, Mr. Worthing.
|They savour of the heretical views of the Anabaptists,
|views that I have completely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons.
|However, as your present mood seems to be one peculiarly secular,
|I will return to the church at once.
|Indeed, I have just been informed by the pew-opener that for the last hour and a half
|Miss Prism has been waiting for me in the vestry.
|Miss Prism!  Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism?
|Yes, I am on my way to join her.
|Pray allow me to detain you for a moment.
|This matter may prove to be one of vital importance to Lord Bracknell and myself.
|Is this Miss Prism a female of repellent aspect,
|remotely connected with education?
|She is the most cultivated of ladies, and the very picture of respectability.
|It is obviously the same person.
|May I ask what position she holds in your household?
|I am a celibate, madam.
|Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last three years
|Miss Cardew's esteemed governess and valued companion.
|In spite of what I hear of her, I must see her at once.
|Let her be sent for.
|She approaches; she is nigh.
|I was told you expected me in the vestry, dear Canon.
|I have been waiting for you there for an hour and three-quarters.
|Prism! Come here, Prism!
|Prism!  Where is that baby?
|Twenty-eight years ago, Prism, you left Lord Bracknell's house,
|Number 104, Upper Grosvenor Street,
|in charge of a perambulator that contained a baby of the male sex.
|You never returned.
|A few weeks later, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police,
|the perambulator was discovered at midnight,
|standing by itself in a remote corner of Bayswater.
|It contained the manuscript of a three-volume novel
|of more than usually revolting sentimentality.
|But the baby was not there!
|Prism!  Where is that baby?
|Lady Bracknell, I admit with shame that I do not know.
|I only wish I did.
|The plain facts of the case are these.
|On the morning of the day you mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory,
|I prepared as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator.
|I had also with me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag
|in which I had intended to place the manuscript of a work of fiction
|that I had written during my few unoccupied hours.
|In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I never can forgive myself,
|I deposited the manuscript in the basinette, and placed the baby in the hand-bag.
|But where did you deposit the hand-bag?
|Do not ask me, Mr. Worthing.
|Miss Prism, this is a matter of no small importance to me.
|I insist on knowing where you deposited the hand-bag that contained that infant.
|I left it in the cloak-room of one of the larger railway stations in London.
|What railway station?
|Victoria.  The Brighton line.
|I must retire to my room for a moment.
|Gwendolen, wait here for me.
|If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life.
|What do you think this means, Lady Bracknell?
|I dare not even suspect, Dr.
|I need hardly tell you that in families of high position
|strange coincidences are not supposed to occur.
|They are hardly considered the thing.
|Uncle Jack seems strangely agitated.
|Your guardian has a very emotional nature.
|This noise is extremely unpleasant.
|It sounds as if he was having an argument.
|I dislike arguments of any kind.
|They are always vulgar, and often convincing.
|It has stopped now.
|I wish he would arrive at some conclusion.
|This suspense is terrible.  I hope it will last.
|Is this the hand-bag, Miss Prism?
|Examine it carefully before you speak.
|The happiness of more than one life depends on your answer.
|It seems to be mine.
|Yes, here is the injury it received
|through the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and happier days.
|Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a temperance beverage,
|an incident that occurred at Leamington.
| And here, on the lock, are my initials.
| I had forgotten that in an extravagant mood I had had them placed there.
|The bag is undoubtedly mine.
|I am delighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me.
|It has been a great inconvenience being without it all these years.
|Miss Prism, more is restored to you than this hand-bag.
|I was the baby you placed in it.
|You?
|Yes... mother!
|Mr. Worthing!  I am unmarried!
|Unmarried!  I do not deny that is a serious blow.
|But after all, who has the right to cast a stone against one who has suffered?
|Cannot repentance wipe out an act of folly?
|Why should there be one law for men, and another for women?
|Mother, I forgive you.
|Mr. Worthing, there is some error.
|There is the lady who can tell you who you really are.
|Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive, but would you kindly inform me who I am?
|I am afraid that the news I have to give you will not altogether please you.
|You are the son of my poor sister, Mrs. Moncrieff,
|and consequently Algernon's elder brother.
|Algy's elder brother!
|Then I have a brother after all.
|I knew I had a brother!  I always said I had a brother!
|Cecily, how could you have ever doubted that I had a brother?
|Dr. Chasuble, my unfortunate brother.
|Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother.
|Gwendolen, my unfortunate brother.
|Algy, you young scoundrel, you will have to treat me with more respect in the future.
|You have never behaved to me like a brother in all your life.
|Well, not till to-day, old boy, I admit.
|I did my best, however, though I was out of practice.
|My own!  But what own are you?
|What is your Christian name, now that you have become some one else?
|Good heavens! I had quite forgotten that point.
|Your decision on the subject of my name is irrevocable, I suppose?
|I never change, except in my affections.
|What a noble nature you have, Gwendolen!
|Then the question had better be cleared up at once.
|Aunt Augusta, a moment.
|At the time when Miss Prism left me in the hand-bag, had I been christened already?
|Every luxury that money could buy, including christening,
|had been lavished on you by your fond and doting parents.
|Then I was christened!  That is settled.
|Now, what name was I given?  Let me know the worst.
|Being the eldest son you were naturally christened after your father.
|Yes, but what was my father's Christian name?
|I cannot at the present moment recall what the General's Christian name was.
|But I have no doubt he had one.
|He was eccentric, I admit.
|But only in later years.
|And that was the result of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion,
|and other things of that kind.
|Algy!  Can't you recollect what our father's Christian name was?
|My dear boy, we were never even on speaking terms.
|He died before I was a year old.
|His name would appear in the Army Lists of the period, I suppose, Aunt Augusta?
|The General was essentially a man of peace, except in his domestic life.
|But I have no doubt his name would appear in any military directory.
|The Army Lists of the last forty years are here.
|These delightful records should have been my constant study.
|Generals M. Mallam, Maxbohm, Magley, what ghastly names they have,
|Markby, Migsby, Mobbs, Moncrieff!
|Lieutenant 1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, General 1869.
|Christian names: Ernest John.
|I always told you, Gwendolen, my name was Ernest, didn't I?
|Well, it is Ernest after all.  I mean it naturally is Ernest.
|Yes, I remember now that the General was called Ernest,
|I knew I had some particular reason for disliking the name.
|Ernest!  My own Ernest!
|I felt from the first that you could have no other name!
|Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly
|that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth.
|Can you forgive me?
